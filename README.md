Macroinvertebrate Image Analysis System

Unit: Software Technology 1 (4483) — Assignment 3  
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kennethtm/stream-macroinvertebrates

Project Goal

This application analyses a macroinvertebrate image dataset through three stages: exploratory data analysis (Stage 1), image classification (Stage 2), and an interactive deployment interface (Stage 3). The goal is to demonstrate object-oriented software design using Python packages including Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Tkinter.

Main Features

- Dataset indexing — scans the image folder and builds a structured table
- Class distribution analysis — bar chart of images per class
- Image size and channel distribution charts
- Aspect ratio scatter plot by class
- Sample image grid
- EDA summary text report
- Baseline Random Forest image classifier (grayscale, 128×128 features)
- Confusion matrix heatmap and classification report
- Interactive console menu application
- Tkinter GUI with image preview and live prediction

Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url> **this repo**
cd macro_project

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dataset Setup

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kennethtm/stream-macroinvertebrates
2. Extract the contents into data/raw/
3. The expected structure is: data/raw/<ClassName>/<image>.jpg
**this step is specified in case you want to change the dataset -> in which case, download a different dataset and put it in the same place. 
Update the config file to match the new dataset.

How to Run

Full non-interactive pipeline (Stage 1 + Stage 2)

```bash
python main.py
```

Interactive console menu (all stages)

```bash
python -m src.console_app
```

Tkinter GUI (all stages)

```bash
python -m src.app
```
